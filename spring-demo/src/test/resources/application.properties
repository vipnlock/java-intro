# The standard properties file that Spring Boot picks up automatically
# when running an application is called application.properties
# and resides in the src/main/resources folder.
#
# If we want to use different properties for tests, then we can override the properties file
# in the main folder by placing another file with the same name in src/test/resources.
#
# The application.properties file in src/test/resources folder should contain the standard
# key-value pairs necessary for configuring a data source. These properties are prefixed with spring.datasource.

# Datasource
#spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
#spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/spring-demo
#spring.datasource.username=postgres
#spring.datasource.password=postgres4ever

# Spring MVC
spring.mvc.view.prefix=/WEB-INF/jsp/
spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp
